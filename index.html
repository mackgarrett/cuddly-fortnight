	<h1>Behind the Digital Screen &ndash; Gmackenz's Index</h1>
	
	<h1>Answer to A4</h1>
	<p> When I zoomed in on the page, the picture was larger and easier to see/distinguish that it was a tree. When I resized the page, I had to scroll over to be able to see all of its content and it also changed how the text on the page was presented, i.e. the width of the columns of the text.  </p>
	
	<h1>Answer to A6</h1>
	<p>The letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; appears 90 times.</p>
	
	<h1>Answer to A7</h1>
	<p>I recognize the meaningful comments tag, &lt;&ndash; &ndash;!&ndash; &ndash;&gt;, from lecture, which is the text that only shows on the source page, but it is not presented on the actual page. I also recognize &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;, which shows the title of the page (for me, the title name shows up in the tab in my internet browser). I also recognized the body tag from the assigned reading, which is where the content of the page goes. </p>
	
	<h1>Answer to A9</h1>
	<p>This CSS file differs from and HTML file because it does not have the header or body features. Also, the CSS file text is more aligned to the left unlike HTML where there is more white space. The CSS is in all black text, while the HTML file has different colored texts. The first familiar things I noticed were the different selectors (h1, h4, etc.) from the reading on CSS, and I also recognized the font-family property and it&rsquo;s value (arial, helvetica, sans-serif in h1).</p>

	<h1>Answer to A11</h1>
	<p> I compared Chrome and Firefox. For the source page, I noticed the html looked the same in both browsers. Also, both browsers displayed the html the same. However, when I zoomed in on the picture of the tree on Chrome, I was able to zoom in much further than I was able to zoom in on the tree in Firefox. Furthermore, when I zoom out as far as possible on both browsers, I noticed that when I resized the zoomed out page, the content on the page was compressed differently than it was when I did the same thing in Chrome.
